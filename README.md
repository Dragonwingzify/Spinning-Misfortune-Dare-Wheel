# Spinning Misfortune

# Description

  My mission is to inject fun and excitement into gaming by adding a
  spin-based challenge element to the mix. We're all about turning
  defeats into opportunities for laughter and creativity.

  A concept where players spin the wheel after losing a game
  (like Counter-Strike) and embark on exciting challenges. The
  challenges are designed to keep the fun flowing even when victory
  seems out of reach.

## Features
- Add a challenge.
- Delete a challenge.
- See how many times the challenge has been done in the History section.

## Dependencies
- react-custom-roulette
- Mongoose
- dotenv
- React
- React Router
- TailwindCSS
- nodemon
- express

Instructions on how to install the project and its dependencies. Include any prerequisites that need to be installed beforehand.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/Spinning-Misfortune-Dare-Wheel.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash

    After installing dependencies, navigate to the `backend` and `punish-wheel` directories individually.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash
    cd ../punish-wheel
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the backend server:**

    Inside the `backend` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the backend server.

5. **Start the frontend server:**

    Inside the `punish-wheel` directory, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server for the frontend and you should be able to access the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
